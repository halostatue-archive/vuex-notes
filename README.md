# vuex-notes

A simple Vue.js project exploring Vuex, based on a tutorial by
[coligo](http://coligo.io/learn-vuex-by-building-notes-app/). The original
tutorial was written for Vuex 1.x; I have updated this to work with Vuex 2.x.

This particular repo was created with `vue init webpack`.

Tests will be added later.

## Build Setup

I recommend the use of `yarn` instead of `npm`.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
yarn run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
yarn run build -- --report

# run unit tests
yarn run unit

# run e2e tests
yarn run e2e

# run all tests
yarn test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the
[guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for
vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
